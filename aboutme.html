         Although I currently live in Edinburgh, I was born and bred in Leeds. I've always had an interest in both geography and science and decided the best thing for me to do would be a mix of the two. I enrolled at The University of Manchester to do a degree in Environmental Science and within the first month I knew I wanted to carry on studying beyond my undergraduate. My undergradute dissertation was on the formation of ice crystals in clouds at different temperatures. It was a simple experiment in a cloud chamber but it spurned me on towards a masters degree at The University of Leeds in Physics of the Earth and Atmosphere. Straight after my masters I started a PhD in atmospheric chemistry at The University of Edinburgh.

            I am currently in my 3rd year of a PhD in atmospheric chemistry at The University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on using model simulations to better understand the chemistry that occurs within smoke plumes from forest fires. The model I use is the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (GEOS being the Goddard Earth Observing System - a weather forecast from NASA used within the model). I am interested in ozone formation when emissions from forest fires mixes with other emissions (both anthropogenic biogenic). As ozone is secondary pollutant (its not emitted directly - it is created when other chemicals emitted react with each other) understanding its formation is key in understanding air quality.<br><br>
	  I have recently published a paper titled Origin, Variability and Age of Biomass Burning Plumes Intercepted during BORTAS-B (found <a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/13789/2014/acp-14-13789-2014.html">here</a>). This paper looks at how well the GEOS-Chem model can represent the carbon monoxide (CO) observed during the BORTAS campaign and where the CO came from. The paper also uses a new technique to age biomass burning plumes - an important metric in understanding the chemistry involved within the plume.

            Since my masters course I have taught myself to code in a few different languages and I am still learning a lot. Most of my work currently is a mix of Python programming for data analysis and data visualisation and FORTRAN programming for changing and running the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model I work with. Although I used to work in IDL I no longer do much work with it (mainly because of the cost). <br><br>
            I also have taught myself to work with HTML and CSS (as you can see from this website). I really enjoy the coding aspect of my work and I'm always looking for new projects to try out and develop my skills. I'm aiming to learn other languages as well, it seems like Ruby, PHP and C would be useful, but I need to come up with a project that uses them first.

            Cycling is becoming a big passion of mine. I have cycled all my life but have only recently started to go on longer trips. I have a touring bike and plan on cycling round Scotland with it and a tent on the back.
