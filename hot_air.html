            Air Quality in China - 02/02/2015
        </p>
        <p class="hotair_body">
          Its no secret that air quality in major Chinese cities is pretty horrendous. But a recent set of pictures present in the Guardian online really shows the extent of the awful conditions expereienced by the residents. One of the most shocking things for me - although not entirely surprising is the lines of toddlers being given intravenous drips due to respiratory problems. Levels of PM2.5 were reported to be at 50 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing - the safe level recommended by the World Health Organisation is 25 micrograms per cubic metre.</p>

	<p class="hotair_body"> I suppose the silver lining is that this problem isn't being ignored. Legislation is slowing coming into effect which will hopefully change things for the better. The full set of pictures can be found <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/feb/25/air-pollution-in-china-in-pictures">here</a>.  </p>

            Ozone in North America - 01/02/2015
        </p>
        <p class="hotair_body">
          I've been modelling ozone in North America - with the objective to compare this model to observations taken during the BORTAS campaign. This campaign took place in July 2011 and looked at the outflow of pollution from boreal forest fires (more information can be found <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/research/eochem/bortas/">here</a>. It was found during BORTAS that ozone is created downwind from forest fires in this region (shown in this <a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/7321/2013/acp-13-7321-2013.html" class="hot_air_link">paper</a> ). Now we want to know whether we can model this production of ozone to match the observations. I've created this animation of surface ozone during the campaign period (July 2011) showing the daily cycle of ozone creation and destruction.</p>
	<div class="hot_air_div"><img class="hot_air_pics" src="ozone_july.gif"></div>
	<p class="hotair_body">	You can see the daily cycle of ozone production - even the movement of the sun from east coast to west. There is also evidence of a large forest fire - from the 15th to the 18th of July you can see a large production of ozone start up at 90 &deg; W and 50 &deg; N. The spot where the fire is cycles between a high concentration during the day and a very low concentrations during the night - implying some interesting chemistry over the area. There is also a nice plume of ozone coming off the east coast and swirling into the Atlantic. The next step is to see if this modelled ozone matches the observations taken during the BORTAS measurement campaign.

            Welcome to my website! - 25/01/2015
        </p>
        <p class="hotair_body">
          I've decided I'd create myself a website. I'm going to try and keep this page up to date with various short entries about anything from my work to thoughts about the environment to projects/problems/successes with coding.
	  <br><br> As a bit of a caveat - this is a work in progress and part of the motivation of this website is to teach myself how to properly make websites. I am also using github as a temporary host so the site might be a bit unstable. If there are any issues or if there are any posts that you want clarifying then let me know - you can get my contact details in the contact page.
