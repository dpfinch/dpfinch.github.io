          Below are some ramblings about various things. Some are about my work as a PhD student. Others about code I'm developing. Some about the world at large. Enjoy.

            Steps towards understanding ozone
        </p>
        <p class="hotair_body">
            I've been looking at what are the key reactions in producing and loosing ozone - from source to sink. I want to know what the impact of different emissions have on the overall ozone. This is a particulaly difficuly problem because of the production and removal cycle of ozone and the tipping points of some chemicals such as NO<sub>2</sub>. When a number of chemical are in low abundance then they will follow certain reactions and when they are in high abundance they will follow others. This mean that it is not a simple case of 'if you have more pollution from a souce then there will be more ozone'.

        <p class="hotair_body">
        I am specifically looking at biomass burning to begin with. This is for a few reasons, firstly, and most importantly, it is because I have easy access to data collected from the BORTAS campaign which gathered information about forest fires in boreal Canada. Secondly, forest fires are an interesting source of pollution. They can vary massively in size, duration, intensity and fuel type. They are also high intensity events which can have a large impact on local air quality in quite a massive way and thirdly, less is known about forest fires and what is known is unconstrained in many ways (since they are highly variable).

            Things to do with my Website
        </p>
        <p class="hotair_body">
        I need to link my html files to the Django framework. I want to be able to add these entries easily and maybe put comments on them. I also need to think about how to upload all this to a server. And while I'm at it, choose a server. I also need to make sure newest post comes first.

	  This is mainly just a test to see what I can do with github stuff. This might be a good starting point to have something out and about.
